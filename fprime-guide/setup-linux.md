# Setting Up Fprime

_Note: If you are a [Windows](/fprime-guide/setup-windows) user, or a [Mac OS](/fprime-guide/setup-mac) user, you should click on the respective operating system and follow that guide instead._

**TL;DR** - This [shell script](/scripts/fprime-install) can be run to automate the following steps. It installs all the necessary dependencies, builds the fprime Ref application, and deploys the ground station HTML GUI.

The following guide explains how to set up Fprime for a linux operating system. It will cover how to install the system dependencies and how to check the installation.

## Installing System Dependencies

### Cloning the repo

* `apt update` (it should ask you for your sudo password. If it doesn't, append `sudo` at the start of the command to resolve the permission errors. (e.g. `sudo apt update`))
* `apt install git`
* `git clone https://github.com/sc-odin/fprime.git` (that's our fork of the fprime)
  * for NASA's : `git clone https://github.com/nasa/fprime`
* The path of your copy of your repo will henceforth be referred to as `<path/to/fprime/checkout>`

### Installing PIP for Python 3

* `sudo apt install python3-pip`

### Create a Virtual environment

* `sudo apt install python3-venv`
* Then run `python3 -m venv ./fprime-venv` (preferably in the same parent folder that contains the F' repo)
* You can now execute `. ./fprime-venv/bin/activate` to go into the virtual environment
  * You might want to copy the `venv.sh` [file](https://github.com/laurentlaurent/Setting-Up-FPrime/blob/master/venv.sh) available in this repo in the same folder as your `fprime-venv` to make it easier to launch the virtual environment
  * If you do so, make sure to `chmod +x venv.sh`
  * Then you'll be able to switch to the fprime-venv using `. ./venv.sh`
* When you're switched, your terminal should show `(fprime-venv)`

_Note: Any time the user wishes to work with Fprime, this virtual environment should be activated. This should be done in each new shell the user uses._

### Installing other dependencies

From here on out, you should be on the fprime-venv unless otherwise specified.

FPrime has a script that will install other ubuntu packages for you

* `sudo ./fprime/mk/os-pkg/ubuntu-packages.sh`

Now see if you have the rest of the dependencies

* `which gcc`
  * if that command displays something like `/usr/bin/gcc`, then (optional) do `apt upgrade gcc`
    * else do `apt install gcc`
* `which g++`
  * if that command displays something like `/usr/bin/g++`, then (optional) do `apt upgrade g++`
    * else do `apt install g++`
* `which cmake`
  * if that command displays something like `usr/bin/cmake`, then (optional) do `apt upgrade cmake`
    * else do `apt install cmake`
* Also install:
  * `pip3 install numpy`
  * `pip3 install pytest`
  * `pip3 install wheel`
  * `pip3 install -r fprime/mk/python/pip_required_build3.py` (run this on the parent folder of the fprime repo)

### Installing the Arm toolchain compilers

* `apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf`
* `apt install g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf`

### Install Fprime Python Requirements

_Note: `<path/to/fprime/checkout>` is the path to your clone of the fprime repo._

* Go to the fprime repo folder: `cd <path/to/fprime/checkout>`
* `pip3 install ./Fw/Python`
* `pip3 install ./Gds`

## Checking your Fprime Installation

_Note: `<path/to/fprime/checkout>` is the path to your clone of the fprime repo._

Now you should be done with installing dependencies. Check your installation with these commands.

* `cd Ref` (you should be in `./fprime/Ref` after)
* `fprime-util generate` should return no error
* `fprime-util build --jobs 32` should return no error (it looks really cool)
* `fprime-util install --jobs 32` should return no error (it looks really cool)
* Go back to the parent folder of the `fprime repo`
* Run `fprime-gds -g html -r <path/to/fprime/checkout>/Ref/build-artifacts` (this won't work if you have not done all 3 of the generate, build and install before)
