# SC-Odin Documentation {docsify-ignore-all}

This website has been created with the help of [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).

It aims to serve documentation for the development of the SC-ODIN satellite by the [Space Concordia Spacecraft team](http://www.spaceconcordia.ca/en/). Throughout the document, you can find [Fprime guides](/fprime-guide/index), [Github guides](/git-guide/index) and other guides that may be useful when trying to understand how the cubesat works.

All main subjects are shown on the sidebar and if you wish to look for a specific section you can use the search bar.

Additionally, if you wish to contribute, take a look at the following [guide](/contribution-guide/index). Additionally, if you want to report an issue or a possible enhancement, first see in [issues](https://github.com/spaceconcordia/sc-odin-docs/issues) if anything similar has been mentioned, if that's not the case, you can create a new [issue](https://github.com/spaceconcordia/sc-odin-docs/issues/new). **Please make sure you follow the templates that we offer**.

## How To Use

In order to use it's very simple. First clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sc-odin/docs/
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

And then type the following command

```bash
docsify serve ./docs
```

Note that I just used `./docs` to symbolize the path to the repo.
